Today I have been thinking a lot about toys and treats. The humans keep saying that I am ""treat motivated lol @ humans - what dog isn't? For real. What dog isn't because I would love to take those treats off their hands?

I've also been thinking about how much fun I had at the Greenbelt with my volunteer friend - so many treats - so many smells. Is that what Paris is like? I would really like more green belt time and more treats. Did I mention treats before?

I've also been dreaming about my forever home. I want to be the only dog for sure; I am the main character after all. I also want my crate there. I like my crate; especially when there are treats inside. I was also thinking about how I would be a great roommate and then I could have my own jar of treats. 

PS: I hope they have toys.
PSS: and treats.
